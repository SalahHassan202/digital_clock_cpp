## ⏰ digital_clock_cpp

### 📌 About This Repository:
This repository contains the code for a simple **digital clock** built using **C++**. The program prompts the user to enter the starting time (hours, minutes, seconds), then continuously updates and displays the current time every second. It uses a menu-free, console-based display and refreshes the screen using `system("cls")` for a real-time clock effect.

### ⚙️ Features:
- Real-time time display  
- Automatic time incrementation (hours, minutes, seconds)  
- 24-hour format  
- Uses `Sleep(1000)` for second-wise updates
